      Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the
      development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The
      primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
      choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the
      primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to
      their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
      definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for
      prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition,
      developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to
      further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap
      has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more
      prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight. Bootstrap also comes
      with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries
      like jQuery. They provide additional user interface elements such as
      dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and
      carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS
      declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also
      extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including
      for example an auto-complete function for input fields.
